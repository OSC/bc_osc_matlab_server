        - **any** - (*96 cores*) Use any available Cardinal node. This reduces the
          wait time as there are no node requirements.
        - **gpu** - (*96 cores*) Use an Cardinal node that has an [NVIDIA H100
          GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/). There are 32
          of these nodes on Cardinal.
        - **hugemem** - (*96 cores*) Use an Cardinal node that has 2 TB of
          available RAM as well as 96 cores. There are 16 of these nodes on
          Cardinal. Requesting these nodes always reserve entire nodes.
